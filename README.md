# Penetration-lab-setup
# Objective:
The goal of this project is to set up a controlled environment where you can practice and hone your penetration testing skills. This lab will simulate real-world scenarios and allow you to test various security tools and techniques without the risk of legal consequences or damaging real systems.

# Requirements:
Hardware:
A computer with at least 8GB of RAM (16GB recommended)
At least 100GB of free disk space
A reliable internet connection
Software:
Virtualization Software (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware)
Kali Linux (as the attacking machine)
Vulnerable OS Images (e.g., Metasploitable, OWASP Broken Web Applications Project)
Network Simulation Tools (e.g., GNS3, Cisco Packet Tracer)
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) tools and packages
Steps to Set Up the Penetration Testing Lab:
# Install Virtualization Software:

Download and install VirtualBox or VMware Workstation Player VirtualBox is preferable.
Create a virtual network within the software to isolate your lab environment.
# Set Up the Attacking Machine:

Download the Kali Linux ISO from kali.org
Create a new virtual machine in your virtualization software and install Kali Linux.
Configure network settings to ensure the attacking machine can communicate with other virtual machines.
# Set Up Vulnerable Machines:

Download vulnerable OS images Metasploitable.
Create separate virtual machines for each vulnerable OS image.
Ensure these machines are on the same virtual network as the Kali Linux machine.
Configure Network Settings:

Set up a virtual network that allows all virtual machines to communicate with each other while being isolated from your host network.
Use NAT or host-only adapters to manage network traffic within your lab.
# Install Additional Tools:

On Kali Linux, install additional tools such as Nmap, Wireshark, Burp Suite, and Metasploit.
Configure these tools to work within your virtual network.
# Test the Environment:

Perform basic network scans using Nmap from Kali Linux to ensure connectivity.
Access web applications on the vulnerable machines to verify they are functioning and exploitable.
# Simulate Attacks:

Practice different penetration testing techniques on the vulnerable machines.
Document each step and result of your tests to analyze the vulnerabilities and the effectiveness of your attacks.
Regular Maintenance and Updates:

Regularly update your Kali Linux machine and other tools to ensure you have the latest features and security patches.
Periodically add new vulnerable machines or update existing ones to keep your lab environment dynamic.
